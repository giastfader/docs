Update objects fields
---------------------

Available since version 0.7.2

Starting from version 0.7.2 it is possible to update single fields of an
object in a collection without sending the whole object JSON
representation to the server .

A new endpoint was added to the BaasBox Document API

``PUT /document/:collection/:id/(.:fieldName)+``

**Headers**: See authorization header in the :doc:`general_remarks`

**Description**: Modify a single field specified by the fieldname
parameter: the fieldName must start with a . could be a simple property
or a complex JSON object or even an array using the notation
.array[index] where index is a valid integer.

**Body payload**: A JSON object with a "data" field (see examples below)

**Returns**:

-  Code 400: the X-BAASBOX-APPCODE contains an invalid application code
-  Code 403: FORBIDDEN, the user does not have the necessary privilege
   to update the document
-  Code 500: the servers cannot fulfill the request, an internal server
   error occurred
-  Code 404: the specified collection does not exist
-  Code 200: OK and the internal JSON document representation


Some examples of the new API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will use the simple object below to explain the new feature modifying
its fields:

::

    {"title":"a simple post","content":"the content of this awesome post"}

Saving the object to a **posts** collection will return the object with
the following ID **a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856**

Let's say we want to modify the title

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.title and with the
following request body

::

    {"data":"this is the new title"}

Will return the following JSON

::

    {
    "result": "ok",
    "data": {
        "@ID": "#24:0",
        "@version": 3,
        "@class": "posts",
        "title": "this is the new title",
        "content": "the content of this awesome post",
        "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856"
    },
    "http_code": 200
    }

As you can see we are using a dot before the field name in the URL of
the request.

A post without tags is not a real post so let's add it as an array of
strings:

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.tags and with the
following request body

::

    {"data":["awesomeness","tag1","tag2"]}

Will return the following JSON:

::

    {
    "result": "ok",
    "data": {
        "@ID": "#24:0",
        "@version": 4,
        "@class": "posts",
        "title": "this is the new title",
        "content": "the content of this awesome post",
        "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856",
        "tags": [
            "awesomeness",
            "tag1",
            "tag2"
        ]
    },
    "http_code": 200
    }

As you can see a tags field was added to the object.

Now let's say that we want to add an element to this tags array:

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.tags[3] with the
following request body

::

    {"data":"new tag"}

Will return:

::

    {
        "result": "ok",
        "data": {
            "@ID": "#24:0",
            "@version": 5,
            "@class": "posts",
            "title": "this is the new title",
            "content": "the content of this awesome post",
            "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856",
            "tags": [
                "awesomeness",
                "tag1",
                "tag2",
                "new tag"
            ]
        },
        "http_code": 200
    }

And what if we want to modify a tag at a specific index?

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.tags[3] with the
following request body

::

    {"data":"new tag modified"}

Will return

::

    {
    "result": "ok",
    "data": {
        "@ID": "#24:0",
        "@version": 6,
        "@class": "posts",
        "title": "this is the new title",
        "content": "the content of this awesome post",
        "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856",
        "tags": [
            "awesomeness",
            "tag1",
            "tag2",
            "new tag modified"
        ]
    },
    "http_code": 200

}

And what about nested objects:

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.author with the
following request body

::

    {"data":{"name":"admin","roles":["admin","superawesome","superuser"]}}

Will return

::

    {
    "result": "ok",
    "data": {
        "@ID": "#24:0",
        "@version": 9,
        "@class": "posts",
        "title": "this is the new title",
        "content": "the content of this awesome post",
        "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856",
        "tags": [
            "awesomeness",
            "tag1",
            "tag2",
            "new tag modified"
        ],
        "author": {
            "roles": [
                "admin",
                "superawesome",
                "superuser"
            ],
            "name": "admin"
        }
    },
    "http_code": 200
    }

The **author** object was added and we can also modify its inner
properties

Making a **PUT** request to the following URL
/document/posts/a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856/.author/.roles[3]
with the following request body

{"data":"optimus prime"}

Will return:

::

    {
    "result": "ok",
    "data": {
        "@ID": "#24:0",
        "@version": 10,
        "@class": "posts",
        "title": "this is the new title",
        "content": "the content of this awesome post",
        "id": "a1b45ea7-7005-4f24-ae5e-76a6840ab856",
        "tags": [
            "awesomeness",
            "tag1",
            "tag2",
            "new tag modified"
        ],
        "author": {
            "roles": [
                "admin",
                "superawesome",
                "superuser",
                "optimus prime"
            ],
            "name": "admin"
        }
    },
    "http_code": 200
    }
